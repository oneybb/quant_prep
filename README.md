Some coding practices I did without ai assistance :>


# List of Questions
## 1. OrderBook Question:
**Summary:**
This question is about using order book updates and trade data to reconstruct orderbook and best bid/ask, calculate slippage and PnL, detect bad market data, and evaluate whether order book imbalance has predictive power

**Focus:**
Order book logic, market microstructure, trade/PnL accounting, time-series joins, fees/rebates, adverse selection, basic statistics, and crypto cross-exchange arbitrage


## 2. HFT MM simulation
**Summary:**
This question asks you to simulate a simple HFT market-making engine that sends/cancels quotes under exchange latency, tracks whether orders become live, estimates fills using queue position, and evaluates PnL and adverse selection.

**Focus:**
Order state machines, event-driven processing, latency, queue position, cancel/replace risk, stale quotes, maker fills, inventory limits, and HFT-style performance metrics.


## 3. Market Making Quote Optimization
** Summary:**
You are given historical quote attempts, market features, fills, and future mid-price moves. Your task is to estimate fill probability, adverse selection, expected quote value, and choose optimal bid/ask quote distances under inventory risk.

**Focus:**
Market-making math, fill probability, adverse selection, expected value, volatility, inventory skew, spread capture, statistical grouping, and quote selection.
